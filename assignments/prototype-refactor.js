Prototype Refactor

1. Copy and paste your code or the solution from yesterday

2. Your goal is to refactor all of this code to use ES6 Classes. The console.log() statements should still return what is expected of them.

// Stretch task: 
// * Create Villain and Hero constructor functions that inherit from the Humanoid constructor function.  
// * Give the Hero and Villains different methods that could be used to remove health points from objects which could result in destruction if health gets to 0 or drops below 0;
// * Create two new objects, one a villain and one a hero and fight it out with methods!
